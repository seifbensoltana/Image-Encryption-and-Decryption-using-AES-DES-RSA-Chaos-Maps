# Image-Encryption-and-Decryption-using-AES-DES-RSA-Chaos-Maps
Image Encryption and Decryption using Symmetric Encryption (AES and 3DES), Assymmetric Encryption (RSA), Chaos Maps (Arnold Cat Map, Henon Map, Logistic Map, Duffing Map) 
Security Analysis: Histogram analysis, Adjacent Pixel Autocorrelation, and Key Sensitivity Analysis 
Creation of an algorithm combining the strengths of Arnold Cat Map and Henon Map. This algorithm also scores high

1st deliverable: a small report with a clear explanation of the main concepts of the studied topic: main components, functional flow,... This will enableto cite and explain the theoretical aspects defined behind image encryption/decryption

2nd deliverable: explains the main characteristics, the advantages and the limits of the existing solutions related to image encryption/decryption

3rd deliverable: contains the design, components and how are the images sent/received. It includes the roles, the functions and their related steps

4th deliverable: specifies the tools used and the development phases

5th deliverable: contains the code
